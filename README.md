**Some common issues that can be addressed through refactoring:**

1.	Code Duplication
○	Extract duplicate code into reusable methods or classes
○	Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

2.  Long Methods
○	Break down long methods into smaller, more focused methods
○	Improve readability and maintainability

3.  Large Classes
○	Split large classes into smaller, more cohesive classes
○	Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

4.  Poor Naming
○	Simplify complex if-else statements
○	Use polymorphism or the Strategy pattern to replace conditional logic

5.  Complex Conditionals
○	Rename variables, methods, and classes to be more descriptive and meaningful
