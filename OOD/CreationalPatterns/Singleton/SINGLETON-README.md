"private static AppSettings instance", 为什么这里要加***static***?  
  
1/ It belongs to the class, ensuring that only one instance exists across the entire application.  
2/ Since it is static, there’s no need to instantiate the class to access it, allowing you to call methods like AppSettings.getInstance() directly.  
  
The ***purpose*** of Singleton design pattern: to restrict instantiation of a class to one object.
