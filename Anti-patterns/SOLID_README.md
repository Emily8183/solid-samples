**A Collection of Common Issues**

1.	Code Duplication  
○	Extract duplicate code into reusable methods or classes  
○	Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle  

2.  Long Methods  
○	Break down long methods into smaller, more focused methods  
○	Improve readability and maintainability  

3.  Large Classes  
○	Split large classes into smaller, more cohesive classes  
○	Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  

4.  Poor Naming  
○	Simplify complex if-else statements  
○	Use polymorphism or the Strategy pattern to replace conditional logic  

5.  Complex Conditionals  
○	Rename variables, methods, and classes to be more descriptive and meaningful  
○	Follow naming conventions and improve code readability  

6.	Poor Exception Handling  
○	Implement proper exception handling and error reporting  
○	Use appropriate exception types and provide meaningful error messages  

7.	Tight Coupling  
○	Reduce dependencies between classes  
○	Apply dependency injection or use interfaces to decouple components
